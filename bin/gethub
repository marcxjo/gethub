  ${0##*/} - A Convenient Git Repository Syncing Tool

  Usage:
    ${0##*/} [ CONFIG_OPTIONS | PROVIDER_OPT ] REPO_TREE


  CONFIG_OPTIONS

  -c GIT_PROVIDER_CONFIG
    Use an alternate repo config to configure the repo sync settings. In
    the current implementation, .conf files are simple and contain at most two
    variables: GIT_PROVIDER_URL and PROVIDER_DIR (both explained below).

    .conf files are assumed to live in the repo config directory (which can be
    overridden by passing the variable CONFIG_DIR into the script). On all
    systems, this currently defaults to \${HOME}/.config.

    This option assumes that the file suffix is not passed as part of the
    argument. When using the default config directory for Linux, passing
    \`-c foo\` sources \${HOME}/.config/gethub/foo.conf.

  -g GIT_PROVIDER_URL
    Configure the Git provider URL if not sourcing a repo config.
    (It's probably just easier to create a repo config file, but this option is
    included for convenience/testing/accommodating your masochism).

  -p PROVIDER_DIR
    Set an alternate provider directory directory (under the source root) for
    the repo to be synced. By default, the provider directory is the directory
    is the directory into which all repos for a specific Git provider are
    grouped. (E.g., the default prefix for GitHub repos, is \`github\`).

    This is useful in case you have a use case that, for whatever reason,
    necessitates having access to an alternate copy of a Git repo.
    Passing \`-r github-2\` will create the repo tree under
    \${SRC_ROOT}/github-2.

  -r SRC_ROOT
    Set an alternate source root directory for the repo to be synced. The source
    root is the top several segments of the path under which all repos synced
    with \`${0##*/}\`, are synced. The default varies by OS, but as an example,
    the source root defaults to ${HOME}/.local/src on Linux.

    This is available in case you're running \`${0##*/}\` in an environment
    where you don't have permission to change the default source root.

  -t
    Run \`${0##*/}\` in test mode. In this mode, all messages logged in the
    default run mode are shown for debugging purposes, but no syncing occurs.


  PROVIDER_OPT

    \`${0##*/}\` ships with a few major Git providers preconfigured as shell
    options. When passing these options, the only other required parameters are
    the URL path segments not included in the root provider URL (see REPO_TREE).

    Passing a default provider option also sets a default provider directory. To
    override the provider directory or even the root provider URL (e.g., to
    substitute in an SSH host definition), you can create a .conf file with the
    same name as the provider's default prefix.

    If you want to override GitHub's root URL, create
    \${HOME}/.config/github.conf with a populated GIT_PROVIDER_URL. (If you
    don't want to override its provider directory, simply don't set a
    PROVIDER_DIR in the file.) To clone or pull a GitHub repo, invoke the script
    normally, passing the \`-g\` flag; you don't need to pass the \`-c\` flag.
    Your overrides file will be picked up and applied with your overrides
    configured.

    -a|--arch|--abs
      Assumes an Arch Linx official svntogit PKGBUILD directory will be synced
      via Git. The default provider directory is \`arch\`.

      NOTE: This option is very likely broken at the moment, as Arch Linux has
      recently migrated all build scripts to GitHub. Use Arch's \`asp\` package
      as a workaround for the meantime if this option fails for you. (Using
      \`-g\` will probably not work, given the architecture of the svntogit
      repo.)

    -b|--bitbucket
      Assumes a Bitbucket repo will be synced. The default provider directory is
      \`bitbucket\`.

    -g|--github
      Assumes a GitHub repo will be synced. The default provider directory is
      \`github\`.

    -u|--aur
      Assumes a repo from Arch Linux's Arch User Repository repo will be synced.
      The default provider directory is \`aur\`.


  REPO_TREE
     The space-separated collection of subpaths in the repo's URL (excluding the
     Git provider's base href). For a GitHub URL, this is usually a collection
     of 2 strings: the repo's username and the repo name itself. The \`.git\`
     prefix should be excluded from the final argument.
